# CreepGame
First Java Project; Not finished and was from my Sophomore year, however it taught me the valuable lesson of object oriented programming.
The game was supposed to work like War and Rock Paper Scissors combined. You had 3 monster types, and both you and the opponent drew cards at the same time. Each card type of monster would do an effect to the opponents deck, altering it; first one to run out of cards first, loses.
